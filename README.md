# SpaCyDiseaseDetectionNLP

Text analytics is used to evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments by comparing various diseases,their outcomes and mode of treatment.  It helps in identifying common symptoms to aid diagnosis and determining the most effective drug compounds for treating large number of population.  It also has developed clinical profiles to give physicians information about their practice patterns and to compare these with those of other physicians and peer-reviewed industry standards.
    In this project, we use NLP to find out the type of disease from the unstructured data obtained.We intend to use an advanced NLP library known as SpaCy which is used for production use which we use for information extraction and pre-processing. Then a CNN model is used to train and finally diseases are recognized from given transcription text.
